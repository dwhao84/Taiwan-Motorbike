## Usage

### Running the Generator
To generate a fresh database with 20,000 motorcycle entries:
```bash
python3 generate_motorcycle_database.py
```

### Loading the Database
```python
import json

# Load the complete database
with open('complete_motorcycle_database.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

motorcycles = data['motorcycles']
print(f"Total entries: {len(motorcycles)}")

# Or load the Taiwan-specific database (2000+ entries)
with open('taiwan_specific_motorcycles.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    taiwan_data = json.load(f)

taiwan_motorcycles = taiwan_data['motorcycles']
print(f"Taiwan specific entries: {len(taiwan_motorcycles)}")

# Example: Find entry-level scooters for students
entry_level = [
    m for m in taiwan_motorcycles 
    if m['target_audience'] == '學生族群' and 
       m['category'] == 'Entry Level'
]

for bike in entry_level[:3]:
    print(f"{bike['brand']} {bike['model']} - {bike['price_range']}")
```

### Filtering Examples
```python
# Filter by brand
honda_bikes = [m for m in motorcycles if m['brand'] == 'Honda']

# Filter by displacement
small_bikes = [m for m in motorcycles if '125cc' in m['engine']['displacement']]

# Filter by type
scooters = [m for m in motorcycles if 'Scooter' in m['type']]
```
